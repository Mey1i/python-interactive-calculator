# Python Interactive Calculator

A simple yet powerful interactive calculator written in Python.  
It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using a clean function-mapping system.  
Users can continue calculations with the previous result, start a new session, or exit at any time.

## 🚀 Features
- Supports +, -, *, /
- Function mapping for cleaner code
- Loop-based calculation system
- Ability to continue with the previous result
- Option to restart the calculator
- Beginner-friendly structure

## 📌 How It Works
1. The user enters the first number.
2. Selects an operation.
3. Enters the next number.
4. The calculator prints the result.
5. The user can:
   - Continue calculating with the result
   - Restart with a new number
   - Quit the program

## 🧩 Code Structure
- Individual functions for each operation (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`)
- A dictionary storing operation symbols mapped to functions
- A main `calculator()` function controlling program flow

## ▶️ Running the Program
Make sure Python 3 is installed.
